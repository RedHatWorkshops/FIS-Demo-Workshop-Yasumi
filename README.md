# Welcome to the Yasumi Puzzler Workshop

This project has 2 major parts in the repository.

## Implementation

The first part is the complete solution that you can find in the repository under the **/Implementation** Directory.

All needed information can be found in the documentation that comes along:

* [Implementation](/docs/Implementation/README.md "Implementation Documentation")

## Labs

The Labs allow you to create the whole implementation in a workshop style where 6 labs take you through the implementation details. These will also guide you through 3 different deployment possibilities. All of this is driven by the developers point of view and needs a running Container Development Kit or OCP instance.
